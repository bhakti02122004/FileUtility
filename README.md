# FileUtility - CodTech Internship Task 1

This is a simple Java console application created for the **CodTech Internship Task 1**. It's a command-line utility that demonstrates basic file handling operations in Java.

## 🚀 Features

The application provides a simple menu to perform the following operations on a local file named `sample.txt`:

* **1. Write to File:** Creates a new file (or overwrites an existing one) with text provided by the user.
* **2. Read from File:** Reads all content from the `sample.txt` file and displays it in the console.
* **3. Modify File:** Appends new text to the end of the existing file without overwriting its current content.
* **4. Exit:** Terminates the application.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Java**
* **Java IO Package** (`BufferedReader`, `BufferedWriter`, `FileWriter`, `FileReader`)
* **java.util.Scanner** (for handling user console input)
